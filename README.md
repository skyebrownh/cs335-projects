# CS335: Graphics and Multimedia - Java Projects

This repository is a group of Java projects completed during the University of Kentucky's CS335 Graphics and Multimedia (Fall 2020) class.

I started this class with no programming experience in Java. The goal of this class was to learn 2D computer graphics, digital image manipulation, and user interface design using Java.

Each project has an associated README to describe its functionality in depth:
- [abundant](./abundant/README.md)
- [calc](./calc/README.md)
- [memorygame](./memorygame/README.md)
- [sieve](./sieve/README.md)
- [sievegui](./sievegui/README.md)
