# Abundant

"An integer is said to be _abundant_ if the sum of its proper divisors, including 1 (but not the number itself) are greater than the number."

*Example: 24*
- 24 has the following proper divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
- The sum of 24's proper divisors is 36
- 36 > 24 so 24 is abundant
- The *_abundance_* of 24 is (36 - 24) = 12

This program identifies all odd abundant numbers less than 10,000 and displays the results as console output.
